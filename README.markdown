# SuperAngryBalls

I wrote this iPad app to show off App Development at the career day at my wife's
school (Manzanita Community School, Oakland). It's a simple Angry Birds style
"knock down the bricks" game. It uses OpenGL and the Chipmunk physics engine.

I wrote the game so that I could edit the levels in OmniGraffle (see
Levels/Blank.graffle). As I demoed the app to each class I got the kids to tweak
the level and the name of the app, this way the kids believed they were making
their own game).

It was a great success.

Some of the thank you notes I received from the classes are here:

## Building

Don't forget to do a git submodule update --init --recursive (to grab
TouchOpenGL).

This is not great quality code - it was written in a short weekend as a demo for
4th graders.
